Only a small thing, to implement the logic to show a smart banner if a user comes from an in app browser to our website and leads to Apple app store and Android play store.

things to consider:
no localization/languages
no real smart banner styling
also idk if we need to consider that some logic runs an every page request, or if we can somehow only run the logic when the first request in a session starts.
needs full review before taking it
